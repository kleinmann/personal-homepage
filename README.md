# My personal homepage

This is my try of creating a homepage in Ruby with the help of sinatra, a library for small web apps.

## Modules

Currently it is made up of a front page with personal information and a blog module based on markdown and plain text-files.

## Purpose

The sole purpose for me is learning Ruby by extending the functionality.
I didn't want to learn Ruby for web applications with Rails like many others do, so I decided to take the scenic route with sinatra and start a little further down.

## Gems I'm using
