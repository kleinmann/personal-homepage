## i can haz blog

I just finished this blog module (for now) and it works just like I wanted it to :)

I really like working with [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [haml](http://haml-lang.com/) as I find them _very_ comfortable to work with and they made my quest to learn Ruby a lot more fun.

Ruby just feels so beautiful and I wish I had tried it earlier.
